// The 3D-glass band that opens an email, from the prompt to the JPEG. Two scripts fill it in:
// generate-email-scenes.mts for the re-engagement banners, generate-newsletter-art.mts for the
// header of a newsletter issue. The prompt grammar follows the `rerun-image-glass` skill and is
// shared with scripts/generate-category-art.mts, so a banner, an issue header and a category tile
// read as the same family: only the hero pictogram, the satellites and the tilt change.
//
// Two things are specific to an email. The hero has to be horizontal, because the square-ish render
// is cut down to a wide band and a portrait glyph loses its head and its feet. And the bottom of
// that band fades from the style's absolute black into the card surface, so the art melts into the
// email instead of sitting on it as a black rectangle.
