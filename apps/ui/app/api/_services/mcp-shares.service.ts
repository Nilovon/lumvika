// The sharing half of the account MCP server (app/api/mcp/account/route.ts). It sits between the
// agent half and the template half for a reason: `runTemplateTool` resolves an expert sandbox
// author before its own switch, so anything routed through it pays that gate. Sharing has no gate
// of its own — a link is a transfer to one person behind an unguessable, revocable token, not a
// page anyone installs from — so it has to be reached first, and it resolves nothing before its
// switch either.
//
// Every handler runs as the caller: the workspace for an API key, the member a steward turn speaks
// for. A link exports a coworker's whole setup, so each one takes `manage` on its Box, the rule the
// share dialog holds to. The functions in lib/agents re-check the workspace against the row they load.
