Return ONLY a JSON object, no prose, no code fence:

- name: the coworker's name, two to three words, at most ${AGENT_NAME_MAX} characters, Title Case, same language as the description, no "agent" suffix. null if the description is too short or vague to name.
- apps: slugs from the catalog below that the job needs, named or clearly implied (e.g. "my inbox" implies an email app). Most important first, at most 5. Only slugs from the catalog. [] if none.
- schedule: when the job runs, if the description says so. label is a short rewording (e.g. "Every weekday at 9:00", "When a prospect replies"). source is the exact substring of the description it was read from. null if no timing is stated.

Catalog (slug: name):
${catalog.map(entry => `${entry.slug}: ${entry.name}`).join('\n')}`
