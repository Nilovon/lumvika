// The sharing half of the account server: handing one agent to one person by link, outside the
// marketplace. A share is a template capture without the page — the same engine archive, uploaded
// once and reachable by URL.
//
// Same audience and same rule as account-tools.ts: these descriptions are the only documentation
// the calling model gets. Three things every tool here shares and none of them repeats — the link
// is a bearer capability with no expiry, the copy it carries is frozen at creation, and this API
// only ever emits links: opening one and placing the agent on a board needs a browser.

Returns the three data buckets priced — its memories, its own database, its workspace files — with a count and a size each, how many .env keys and MCP sign-ins the copy will have to be given again (counts only, never names, never values), and warnings naming the literal credentials the engine strips on the way out. None of the three buckets travels unless you name it in create_agent_share, and the Box database and the Box shared files never travel at all: a copy starts with empty ones.

            `Create a link that hands one coworker to someone else: they open it, sign in, and a copy lands on their board with its apps disconnected and its webhooks reissued. Four things about it that are not obvious. The link is a bearer capability with no expiry and no password, so whoever holds the URL can install the coworker until it is revoked — hand it only to the person it is for. The copy is frozen at this call: it never grows afterwards, and renaming, switching off or deleting the source coworker does not change what was sent. \`include\` is empty by default — instructions, skills, scheduled tasks and webhooks are the coworker and travel either way, the three switches are all data belonging to the account owner, and turning any of them on requires confirm: true. Calling this twice on the same coworker with the same \`include\` hands back the link that already exists rather than taking a second snapshot, and says so with reused: true. Whatever you pass, the Box database and the Box shared files stay here, and API keys, connected accounts and chat history never leave the workspace. This streams the coworker folder off its Box, so it is not instant.`,
