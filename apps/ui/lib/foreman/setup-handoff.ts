// The end of the guided setup: the team asks for what it still needs, each agent in its own chat,
// rather than the foreman walking the user through one Apps tab at a time. Every agent is started
// at once and none of them is waited for: what the user sees is their whole company working, and
// then coming back to them one by one with a sign-in card or a question.
//
// So this is send_message without the wait: the engine buffers the run on its side and nothing has
// to stay connected to the stream for the user to be asked. The session row is mirrored here rather
// than left to the notification webhook, which only writes one for a session the engine announced
// with `agent.session.created`, and /chat announces nothing. Without that row the run executes for
// nobody: it never reaches the agent's chat, and the `awaiting_*` state it stops on has nothing to
// be written to.
