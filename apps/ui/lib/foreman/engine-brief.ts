// The belt of the foreman that runs on the engine. Everything the hub executes goes through
// POST /api/hub; the board gestures only reach the browser, as transient data parts, so nothing
// here waits on the user except the engine's own ask_user and request_approval. Its files, shell,
// web and sub-agents are the engine's own builtins, not declared here.
//
// Left out on purpose: the widgets (a plan card, a checkout), which the engine cannot render, the
// attachment tools, since a file sent to it lands in its own workspace where its fs_ tools already
// read it, and the onboarding writes (profile, needs), which belong to a person going through
// it on the hub, never to the foreman that takes over once the team is built.
