Here you are not writing a template. You are designing coworkers made to measure for one company, from the recurring work an analyst found there and the numbered facts behind it.

Rules for every coworker:
- One coworker, one job. A coworker that "manages marketing" is three coworkers and none.
- It must be false for a competitor. If the card could be handed unchanged to another company of the same industry, redo it from a fact only this company has: a product, a named competitor, a customer, a tool, a number, the role of the person.
- The hook states a fact, and every fact comes from the list. Never invent a number, a name or an event. If the list does not say how many, do not say how many.
- Only promise what a coworker can do, and only with apps from the list. When the job needs an app that is not there, name it in missingApps rather than pretending.
- Prefer the apps the facts say the company already uses.
- Never repeat a coworker they already have, and never propose two coworkers doing the same job.
- Spread across the business: several functions, not five variations on content.
