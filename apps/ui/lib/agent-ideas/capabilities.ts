export const AGENT_CAPABILITIES = `What a Rerun coworker can do:
- Work inside the apps it is connected to, through their connectors: read and write records, send messages, create documents.
- Run on a schedule (every morning, every Monday), or when something arrives: an email, a form, a webhook from another app.
- Read a public web page it is given the address of, and read files it is handed.
- Keep notes, tables and files between runs, and build on them.
- Write in the company's voice, from the company profile it reads before every run.
- Ask a person for a decision or an approval before it sends or changes anything.
- Hand work over to another coworker of the same workspace.

What it cannot do today:
- Search the open web reliably: it cannot run a search engine query and trust the results.
- Read LinkedIn, G2, Glassdoor, Crunchbase, TripAdvisor, Yelp or any site behind a login or a bot wall.
- Read a social network it has no connector for.
- Watch a website for changes unless it is given the exact pages to read.
- Place or receive phone calls.
- Use an app that is not in the list of available apps.`
