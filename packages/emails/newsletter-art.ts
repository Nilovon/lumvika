// The header of an issue, described rather than drawn: cloud/packages/cloud/scripts/generate-newsletter-art.mts
// turns one of these into the 3D-glass band served at /email/newsletter/<slug>.jpg. The vocabulary
// is the `rerun-image-glass` one, shared with the re-engagement scenes, so an issue header and a
// lifecycle banner read as the same family: only the hero pictogram, its satellites and the tilt
// change from one to the next.
//
// The hero has to be horizontal. The square-ish render is cut down to a wide band, and a portrait
// glyph comes out of it without its head and without its feet.
