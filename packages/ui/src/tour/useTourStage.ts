// only once it has faded, because the grid has no exit animation for a tile — taken out on the spot,
// eight tools would blink off the plateau in a single frame. Going forward again cancels the timer,
// so a Back immediately followed by a Continue never empties anything.
//
// `landing` is the phase playing its arrival, and it is **state** rather than a comparison redone
// every render: the pieces of a landing phase carry `justPlaced`, whose CSS animation shorthand has
// to stay identical across re-renders or the tiles snap to rest mid-fall. It is set on the way out,
// which is the only direction anything arrives in, and cleared when the plateau finishes shrinking —
// a phase emptied and walked back into is a phase that lands again.
